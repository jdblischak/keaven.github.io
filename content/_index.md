I am a statistician from Merck & Co., Inc. working as the head of Methodology Research in the Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences (BARDS) department.
I have a long standing interest in Phase 3 design of clinical trials with particular interests in group sequential design, survival analysis, and multiplicity.
R software is another major interest as shown in the software tab.
Recent research focuses on testing multiple hypotheses in group sequential design as well as weighted rank-based tests for comparing survival curves.
